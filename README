= ChemRuby - Cheminformatics Ruby

ChemRuby is a framework for developing cheminformatics applications in Ruby.
It will let you retrieve chemical information from variety of data sources
in various formats (such as MDL mol, SMILES etc.), fast substructure search
based on graph theory, draw a chemical structure in various graphics formats
(such as PDF, PNG etc.), and calculate a number of chemical properties.

== FOR MORE INFORMATION

ChemRuby's official website is at ((<URL:http://www.chemruby.org/>)).
You will find links to the related resouces including downloads,
Wiki documentations etc. in the top page.

  * ((<URL:http://www.chemruby.org/>))


== WHERE TO OBTAIN

--- WWW

The releases can be obtained at ChemRuby website.

  * ((<URL:http://www.chemruby.org/>))

--- RubyGems

((<RubyGems|URL:http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/>)) version of
the ChemRuby package is also available for easy installation.

  * ((<URL:http://rubyforge.org/projects/chemruby/>))


== REQUIREMENTS

* Ruby 1.8.2 or later -- ((<URL:http://www.ruby-lang.org/>))


== OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Some optional libraries can be utilized to extend ChemRuby's functionality.
If your needs meets the following conditions, install them from the "Ruby
Application Archive" at ((<URL:http://raa.ruby-lang.org/>)).

For outputting png and jpeg images:

  * [RAA:rmagick]

For testing and developing ChemRuby:

  * [RAA:rake]

== INSTALL

In the chemruby source directory (such as chemruby-x.x.x/), run setup.rb
as follows:

  % ruby setup.rb config
  % ruby setup.rb setup
  % su
  # ruby setup.rb install

If your operating system supports 'sudo' command (such as Mac OS X),
try the following procedure instead of the above.

  % ruby setup.rb config
  % ruby setup.rb setup
  % sudo ruby setup.rb install

You can run tests by

  % rake test

and run

  % rake

for more details.

== USAGE

You can load all ChemRuby classes just by requiring 'chem.rb'.  All the
ChemRuby classes and modules are located under the module name 'Chem' to
separate the name space.

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'chem'

--- RubyGems

In RubyGems, you need to load 'rubygems' library before using 'chem'.

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'rubygems'
  require_gem 'chem'
